### Built with

### What I learned

I learnt how to use CSS Flexbox, CSS Units and  all that there is to learn under it. I also learnt how to add fonts to webpages using font-face.

```html
<div class="img-container">
        <img src="./assets/images/image-qr-code.png" alt="qr-code">
      </div>
```

```css
.container {
  align-items: center;
  display: flex;
  height: 100%;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - This helped me grasp CSS concepts. I really liked how clearly the concepts were explained and will use it going forward.
